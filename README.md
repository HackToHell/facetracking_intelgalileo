# Face tracking using Intel Galileo Gen2 and Python(OpenCV)

A simple application using the Galileo, the list of items needed are

  - 2 x Servos
  - Galileo Board( might run on the Edison, haven't tested)
  - Web Camera (preferably High Definition)
  - Laptop with Python and OpenCV installed.

I am not going to cover the installation of Python and OpenCV, the versions used by me are OpenCV 3.0.0 and Python 2.7.8. I do have a tutorial on setting up [OpenCV 3.0.0 for Visual Studio 2013 here][1]. I planned to write it in C++ originally but swtiched to Python.
